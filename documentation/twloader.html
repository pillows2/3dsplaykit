<h4><font color="red"><center><p style="width:39%">First off, TWLoader requires CFW (at the moment, use Luma3DS). In order to play your roms, you will need to put them in the SD:/roms/nds/ folder. I can't supply you with roms though, so google is your friend.</font><font face="monospace"> Also, to request cover art of your games, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=ryantv" style="text-decoration:none">PM me on reddit with the name of your game.</a></p></center></h4>
